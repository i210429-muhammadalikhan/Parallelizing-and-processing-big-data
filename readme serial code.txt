K Shortest Paths Algorithm:
This program implements the K shortest paths algorithm using a EnronEmail data structure. It reads input from a file, represents the graph, and finds the K shortest paths from a given source node to a destination node.


Compilation Instructions:
To compile the program, follow these steps:

1-Open a terminal or command prompt.
2-Navigate to the directory containing the source code (k_shortest_paths.c) and the input file (EnronEmail.txt).
3-Compile the source code using a C compiler such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) with the following command:
gcc k_shortest_paths.c -o k_shortest_paths
This command will generate an executable file named k_shortest_paths.


Execution Instructions:
After compiling the program, you can execute it by following these steps:

1-Ensure that the input file (EnronEmail.txt) is in the same directory as the compiled executable.
2-Open a terminal or command prompt.
3-Execute the compiled program with the following command:
./k_shortest_paths

Follow the prompts to input the source and destination nodes when prompted.
After providing the necessary inputs such as Source Node and the Destination Node, the program will display the K shortest paths from the specified source node to the destination node.
